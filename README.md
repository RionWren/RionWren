- 👀 I’m interested in multiple things, currently working on cursed stuff such as my main laptop's opencore EFI (please do not ask me for it) as well as nixos configurations for it and other hardware I own
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use nix and nixos as well as working on opencore in a better way than I have in the past.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really.
